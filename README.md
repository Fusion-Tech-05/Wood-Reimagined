# Wood-Aftermath
An attempted revival from the latest Wood RPG source code with hopefully greater flashcart compatibility and an upgraded Anti-Piracy patching engine, or at least more Anti-Piracy patches to bring compatibiltiy, stability, and features at least close to equivlent with the final release of Wood RPG.
Name is a work in progress, like this entire project. It is subject to change, feel free to recomend names to me that you think are better.
